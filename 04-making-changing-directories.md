:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How do I create a new directory?
- How do I move between directories?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Create directories with `mkdir`.
- Change the working directory with `cd`, including using `.` and `..`.
- Use tab completion and command history to save time.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this section, we will learn how to change the current directory and create entirely new ones.

## Create a new directory

To make a new directory, we use the `mkdir` command, supplying a sensible directory name.

```bash
mkdir my_directory
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Did that work?

Some commands (including `mkdir`) do not display a message after they have been executed. You can
check that your `mkdir` command worked with `ls`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Change working directory

Let's change our current working directory to the newly created one with the command `cd` (for
**C**hange **D**irectory).

```bash
pwd
```

```bash
cd my_directory
```

```bash
pwd
```

Note that `cd` can also take the full path as input (the long version that you can see in the
`pwd` output). What we supplied above is called a relative path.

## Hands-on

### 3.1 Create nested directories

It can be very useful to organise your directories into hierarchies. Try creating a new directory
inside *my_directory*. Then create another new directory inside that one.

Change your working directory to the innermost directory.

### 3.2 Change directory with `..`

Often, it is useful to go 'upwards' one level in the directory structure. Two dots **..** are used
in Unix to refer to the parent directory of wherever you are. All directories (besides the root
level) have a parent that can be accessed in this way.

A single dot **.** is used to refer to the current directory (often useful when running
bioinformatics tools).

Try using **..** to change your directory. What about **../..**? What does that represent?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### Hint

Set your working directory back to your innermost directory first.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### Solution

**../..** refers to the parent of the parent directory.

**../../..** refers to the parent of the parent of the parent directory.

And so on...

### 3.3 Save time with tab completion

One great Unix feature you can start using right away is that you can tab complete the names of
files, directories and commands.

Just type enough characters to uniquely identify the name of a file, directory or command, press
<kbd>Tab</kbd> and Unix will do the rest.

If pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> doesn't do anything, then you have not typed enough unique characters.
In this case, pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> twice will show you all of the possible completions.

Try using tab completion to complete directory names as you change directories with `cd`. Think of
all the saved keystrokes!

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### How can I save more time?

Another great time-saver is that Unix stores a list of all of the previous commands that you have
executed in each session. Access this list by using the up and down arrows.

So, if you type a long command but make a mistake, press the up arrow and then you can use the left
and right arrows to move the cursor in order to make an edit.

You could also try the `history` command to print a list of your previous commands.

```bash
history
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- `mkdir` creates directories; many commands stay silent on success, so check with `ls`.
- `cd` changes directory; `.` is the current directory and `..` is the parent.
- Tab completion and the `history` command save a lot of typing.
