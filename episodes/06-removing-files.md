:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How do I delete files and directories safely?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Remove empty directories with `rmdir`.
- Remove files with `rm`, and understand why it is dangerous.
- Use `rm -i` to delete more safely.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this section we'll cover how to safely remove files and directories that you no longer need.

## Remove directories

The `mkdir` command that we used earlier has an analogue for removing directories called `rmdir`.

```bash
rmdir DIRECTORY
```

Helpfully, `rmdir` will only remove an empty directory (so we don't accidentally remove important
files).

## Remove files

To remove files, we have to use the `rm` (remove) command.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: caution

### Please read this section VERY carefully!

Accidental misuse of the `rm` command can lead to huge problems!

If you delete something with `rm`, you will not get it back!

It is possible to delete everything in the file system (all directories and subdirectories) with
`rm`. Let's repeat that last part again: it is possible to delete every file you have ever created
with the `rm` command.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Luckily, there is a way of making `rm` a little bit safer. We can use it with the *-i* flag so that
you will be asked for confirmation before deleting anything.

```bash
rm -i FILE
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Can I use a wildcard character with these commands too?

You can use wildcard characters with any Unix command. However, using wildcards with the `rm`
command is particularly dangerous (we encourage avoiding it altogether).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Hands-on

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### 5.1 Change `rm` behaviour

Usually `rm` does not display a message once it has run. Instead, using a flag, `rm` will use
verbose mode, where it will print the name of each file that has been deleted.

What flag enables verbose mode?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### Solution

*-v* engages verbose mode.

### 5.2 Remove file

Remove the copied file you created in section 4. You can also remove any additional copies you may
have made.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### 5.3 Remove directories

Remove the directories you created in section 3.

Do not remove the *samples* directory.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- `rmdir` removes empty directories only — a useful safety net.
- `rm` deletes files permanently; there is no undo.
- `rm -i` asks for confirmation; avoid combining `rm` with wildcards.
