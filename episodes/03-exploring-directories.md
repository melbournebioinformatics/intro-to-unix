:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- Which directory am I currently in?
- How do I list the files and directories around me?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Print the current working directory with `pwd`.
- List directory contents with `ls` and useful flags.
- Count the lines, words and bytes in a file with `wc`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this section, we will learn how to "look" at the file system and further expand our repertoire
of Unix commands. The machines provided have been set up with some files for us to take a look at.

## Where am I?

There may be many hundreds of directories on any Unix machine, so how do you know which one you are
in? The command `pwd` will **P**rint the **W**orking **D**irectory. If you ever get lost in the
file system, remember the `pwd` command. Try it out.

```bash
pwd
```

Many bioinformatics tools require paths as input. Check your paths with `pwd` before you submit a
job to a job scheduler.

## List available files and directories

What about looking at the contents of a directory? For that, we use the `ls` command (short for
'list').

```bash
ls
```

## Hands-on

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### 2.1 Reveal more information

Run `ls` with the long flag to get more information about the contents of the directory. How did
the output change?

```bash
ls -l
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### Solution

The long flag means that each file or directory is placed on its own line. Extra information is
also included.

```
drwxr-xr-x 2    alpha    alpha   4.0K  Sep  8 23:28 samples
\--------/ ^ \--------/ \-----/ \----/ \----------/ \-----/
permission |  username   group   size      date      name
       /---^---\
       linkcount
```

Where:

- **permissions**: 4 parts, file type, user perms, group perms and other perms
  - *object type*: 1 character, *d* = directory and *-* = regular file
  - *user* permissions: 3 characters, *r* = read, *w* = write, *x* = execute and *-* no permission
  - *group* permissions: same as user except for users within the owner group
  - *other* permissions: same as user except for users that are not in either *user* or *group*
- **username**: user who owns this object
- **group**: group who owns this object
- **size**: number of bytes this object takes to store on disk
- **date**: date and time when this object was last edited
- **name**: name of the object
- **linkcount**: number of links this object has in the file system (safe to ignore)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### 2.2 Upgrade your `ls`

`ls` is a command you're likely to use a lot! Why not find a combination of flags you like.

What does this combination of flags do?

```bash
ls -lhrt
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### Hint

Always remember the `man` command.

```bash
man ls
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### Solution

The command above returns the contents of the current directory in long form (*-l*), sorted in
reverse (*-r*) order of their last edit (*-t*), with file sizes shown in more convenient units
(*-h*).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### 2.3 Compare files

*samples* is a directory; you can tell by the leading 'd' in the long-form `ls` output.

`ls` can be used to list the content of other directories, not just the current one.

```bash
ls -lhrt samples
```

The `wc` (for **W**ord **C**ount) command prints the number of lines, words, and bytes in a file.

```bash
wc samples/sample_c.fastq
```

Which of the 3 FASTQ files has the most lines?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### Hint

`wc` can accept multiple input files with spaces between them.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### Solution

*sample_c.fastq* has the most lines.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- `pwd` prints your current location in the file system.
- `ls` lists directory contents; `ls -l` adds details and `ls -lhrt` is a handy combination.
- `wc` counts lines, words and bytes in one or more files.
